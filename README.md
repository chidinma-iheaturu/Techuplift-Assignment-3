Create Accounts: Users can create accounts by providing their names and an initial deposit amount.
Deposit Funds: After creating an account, users can deposit money into their accounts.
Withdraw Funds: Users can withdraw money from their accounts, given they have sufficient funds.
Check Account Balance: Users can inquire about their account balance at any time.
